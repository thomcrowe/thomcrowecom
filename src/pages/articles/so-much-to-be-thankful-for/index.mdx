I took this whole week off of work. Well, we had a fun Thanksgiving drink-mixing virtual event with work on Monday that was so much fun (my sister caught some video of me dancing that I'm sure will be blackmail material at some point).

While my family was here, we celebrated Thanksgiving together! Looking over the past few years, we had much for which to be thankful. We baked cookies, had a family movie night, and went to the Route 66 Christmas Chutes. We also had an adorable moment with Ellie and her cousin Kade seeing Santa.

All in all, this was a great week. I was sad to see the family go, but Christmas is only a few weeks away.
